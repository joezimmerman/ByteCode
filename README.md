# ByteCode
If you have not already looked at my project report, please do so, here is the link for it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iPiXVlDqWvjRcuAJGO1WV9SyCZjNP4TxutA8EMOCEE/edit

Here is my attempt at the ByteCode project from the book crafting interpreters.

I was able to write most the code from chapters 14-24, but I was unable to debug/run the code to test it. I'm not sure exactly why I couldn't figure out how to debug/run the code, but I didn't have enough time to figure that out exactly. I figured something would be better than nothing in this sitaution. 

In this Github repo, I have provided updates for my progress through the Bytecode project. I provided an update of my code after Chapters 14-17, Chapters 18-21, and then the final submission was for all the code from Chapter 14-24. This can be found underneath the subsequent folders in the code section of this repo. The final submission of my attempted code can be found underneath the folder called: ByteCode FINAL SUBMISSION (Chapters22-24). 

I guess if you wanted to, you could download my code and attempt to run it for yourself, but you probably want get very far since it doesn't work.
